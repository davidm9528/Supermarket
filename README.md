# Supermarket
Touching up on my SQL knowledge by giving myself the task of creating a database simulating a supermarket.
I want to further progress my understanding of hosting my own server and working with git terminal, so I feel this is the best way to do so.

I will be using VS Code with the SQL Server (MSSQL - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension provided by Microsoft to write my SQL statements. 

To run my MySQL server and Apache I am using XAMPP control panel (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
